# sales_analysis_project
this is a small project on data analysis on the sales report obtained by different store locations at different times. I have used the pandas library 
the sales report was taken from the youtube video of KeithGalli, from which I had done project based learning.
As I am now new to coding, I have tried to do my best in understanding and implement the knowledge as much as I can.
# questions solved
1. Which month had the best sales
2. Which city had the best sales
3. Which hour has the best sales
4. Which product has the highest sales
5. Which product unit has the most unit sold
6. Which products are often sold together
# sloving
I have solved these qustions using python
1. first, we start by cleaning up the data as there are many NaN values that were found in the data
2. second, we add a column or remove it for getting the required report 
3. third, we solve the questions using pandas and matplotlib method
